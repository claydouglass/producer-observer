# 2. The Human-in-the-Loop Feedback Loop

**How people teach the system without realizing it**

---

When people accept, reject, or correct something in Vervana Pro, they are not "fixing the AI."

**They are teaching the system how the company actually works.**

## How Actions Become Learning

| User Action | What the System Learns |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Accepting** a proposed update | "This is correct, do more of this." |
| **Rejecting** an update | "This pattern is not right, avoid it." |
| **Correcting** a field | Both the right answer AND the rule behind it |
| **Updating** an SOP or state | Reshapes the workflow rules the system uses |
| **Triggering** an exception | This scenario is special or risky |

---

## What Accumulates Over Time

Each of these tiny actions becomes:

- a data point
- a rule
- a preference
- a correction
- a pattern
- a signal

Over time, these accumulate to form a very accurate picture of:

- how your business operates
- which patterns matter
- which signals are noise
- how decisions are made
- who handles what
- what "normal" looks like
- what "abnormal" looks like

---

## The Positive Feedback Loop

This creates a virtuous cycle:

```
More usage → More learning → Easier to use → More usage
```

**The more people use Vervana, the more it learns how they work.**
And the more it learns, the easier the system becomes to use.

## The Lock-In Effect

This is why no one wants to switch later.

You'd lose all the intelligence you taught it.
